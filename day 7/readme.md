Today I Fetched and Display Data from a Public API Using Fetch API.

I Used HTML to create a container for user data.

I Used JS fetch to request data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.

I Parsed the JSON response.

I Created a Loop through users and display their name, email, and address on the page.

I Created catch block to Handle errors.

I Styled displayed data with CSS.

I Tested network error handling by disabling internet.

I Added a reload button to refetch data.
