Today I Created a Simple Blog Layout Using Bootstrap 5.

This Includes Bootstrap CSS and JS CDN links in index.html.

I Added navbar with brand and links using Bootstrap classes.

I Created a container with several cards representing blog posts.

Each card had an image, title, description, and read more button.

I Used Bootstrap grid to arrange cards responsively.

I Added a footer with social icons.

I Customized spacing and colors using Bootstrap utility classes.

I Tested responsiveness on different screen sizes.
