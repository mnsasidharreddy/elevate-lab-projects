Today i created a to do list web app.

Type a task into the input box.

Click the "+" button to add the task to your list.

After adding tasks, tap on any list item to mark it as complete (i.e: it turns green).

If you accidentally mark the wrong item, tap it again to unmark it.

Each task has a delete button next to it.

Click the delete button to instantly remove that task from the list.

All changes happen immediately without refreshing the page.
